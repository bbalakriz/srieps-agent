# Test manifest to trigger resource quota remediation
# This creates a namespace with restrictive quota, then tries to deploy a pod that exceeds it
#
# PURPOSE: Test the automated remediation-agent feature
#
# HOW TO USE:
#   oc apply -f test-manifests/06-quota-exceeded-pod.yaml
#
# WHAT HAPPENS:
#   1. Creates a namespace (failure-test) with restrictive ResourceQuota
#   2. Deployment attempts to create a pod that exceeds the quota
#   3. SREIPS detects the quota violation event
#   4. SREIPS analyzes the issue and sends a Slack notification
#   5. Slack message includes an interactive "Remediate" button
#   6. Clicking the button triggers the remediation-agent
#   7. Remediation-agent uses OCP MCP server to adjust the quota
#   8. Deployment successfully creates the pod
#
# CLEANUP:
#   oc delete -f test-manifests/06-quota-exceeded-pod.yaml
#   oc delete namespace failure-test

# 1. Create restrictive ResourceQuota
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: test-quota
  namespace: failure-test
  # Remove kubectl annotation to avoid server-side apply conflicts

# 2. Use Deployment to generate continuous FailedCreate events
# Deployment will retry pod creation and generate Warning events that Robusta can catch
